Hello everyone, today I’ll be talking about digital payment platforms and services — things like Apple Pay, WePay, VinPay in Vietnam, and GoPay in Indonesia.

Over the past decade, digital payment platforms have shifted from being convenient add-ons to becoming central pillars of entire economies. What’s especially fascinating is how different regions have adopted them.

In countries like the United States, digital payments grew gradually, layered on top of an existing system of cash, checks, and especially credit cards. But in many developing economies, the transition has been very different. Places like China, Vietnam, and parts of Africa essentially skipped over credit cards and even traditional banks. Instead of relying on decades of banking infrastructure, people jumped directly from cash to smartphone-based wallets.

This means millions of people who never had a bank account can now store money, pay bills, and transfer funds instantly — all through mobile apps. It’s an example of what’s called “leapfrogging technology,” where late adopters don’t copy the older model but instead jump straight into the new one.

But this rapid shift also has huge geopolitical and economic implications. For decades, America has had an outsized role in global finance through networks like SWIFT, Mastercard, and Visa. These systems gave the U.S. tremendous influence, because so much of the world’s money flowed through institutions it could monitor and even sanction.

Now, with the rise of local digital payment platforms — especially in Asia — that monopoly is being challenged. Transactions can increasingly bypass U.S.-controlled systems. It’s reported that Donald Trump and other American policymakers have expressed frustration with this trend, because it could weaken the leverage the U.S. has long enjoyed over the global financial system.

So on one hand, digital payment platforms are empowering everyday people, bringing financial inclusion to communities that were left out before. On the other hand, they’re also reshaping global power dynamics — and software is right at the center of it.

To close, I’d like to leave you with a question:

If software-driven payment platforms can bypass traditional banks and even U.S.-controlled systems, will this lead to a more open and fair global economy — or will it simply create new monopolies in different parts of the world?

Thank you.
